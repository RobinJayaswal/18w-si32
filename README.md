# Project Name

Si32 will be an online environment where players can submit their own bots to play against each other in a very simple Starcraft-style turn-based strategy game. Each bot will control an army of "units" which will build "factories" that will spawn more units; the objective of the game is to destroy all of the opponent's factories. Bots will control all aspects of gameplay and will direct how each and every unit will move. 

Basic functionalities we're hoping to implement:
- The game (obviously)
- A leaderboard
- Basic stats/analysis for each user

Stretch goals:
- Guided tutorials/AIs of incremental difficulties for players to train their bots against
- Statistical analysis during the match (of advantage, positions, etc.)
- Team VS gameplay
- More advanced graphics
