# bot.py
#
# Bot Name: Random
#
# Strategy Overview:
#   Random appears to be the result of an unconstrained evolutionary process
#   â€” one without the feedback provided by natural selection.
#   Random makes not effort to increase the number of hives it controls,
#   and simply directs each unit to move in a random direction on each turn.
#   A loss to Random may suggest that something is desperately wrong with a bot's strategy.
