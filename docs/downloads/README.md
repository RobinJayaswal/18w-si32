# Downloads

Below are various downloads to aid in the bot development process.

### Bot Development Kit

You can download the bot development kit [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/monad-assets/devkit.zip).

The Monad bot development kit contains all of the resources you need to get started
developing your bot. It includes a `bot.py` file containing the scaffolding for a
bot implementation, the `GameHelper` module, the full `Game` library necessary for
running local games on your machine, and several scripts to help optimize your local
bot development experience.

Refer to the `README` contained within the development kit for detailed instructions
on its use.

### Offline Visualizer

You can download the offline visualizer [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/monad-assets/monad-visualizer-0.1.0.dmg).

The Monad offline visualizer is a native desktop application that allows you
to visualize match replays without the use of a web browser or internet connection.
The match replay visualization is identical to that provided by the Monad web client.

To use the offline visualizer, download the `.dmg` file via the link above,
select the file to run the installer, and move the application to your Applications
directory.
