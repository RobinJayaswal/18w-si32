# Sample Bots

Below are download links to and descriptions of various sample bots against
which you can test your strategies.

### Random

Random appears to be the result of an unconstrained evolutionary process
â€” one without the feedback provided by natural selection.
Random makes not effort to increase the number of hives it controls,
and simply directs each unit to move in a random direction on each turn.
A loss to Random may suggest that something is desperately wrong with a bot's strategy.

### Streamer

Streamer does one thing and does it well: streams units as quickly as
they become available towards an enemy hive.
Opponents not prepared to put up an immediate defense against Streamer's
early offensive posture may find themselves in trouble.
However, the low dimensionality of Streamer's strategy may prove easily defensible.

### Waiter

Waiter is Streamer's more patient older brother. Instead of immediately
directing available units into the fray, Waiter holds them back until
a critical threshold of units has been reached, at which point it
unleashes them in a devastating attack.
However, if the enemy manages to ward off this initial onslaught,
Waiter may prove to not have many more tricks left up its sleeves.

### Fortifier

Fortifier seeks to expand outward slowly from the starting
hive location, building new hives in the process.
As its name suggests, Fortifier eventually construct a formidable
map position, but does so in a deliberate, often time consuming manner.
This delay may prove costly against an adaptable opponent.
